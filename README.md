# Next.js Demo Project

This demo project showcases my working knowledge and skills in building modern web applications using:

- **Next.js**: React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **React**: Component-based UI development.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly-typed JavaScript for scalable and maintainable code.
- **Vitest**: Fast unit testing framework.
- **Playwright**: End-to-end testing for web apps.
- **Tailwind CSS 4**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **i18n**: Internationalization support for multi-language applications.

The project demonstrates best practices in development, testing, styling, and localization using these technologies.
